excerpt: "A personal take on why open source is like the best group project ever - no gatekeeping, just people building cool stuff together."Let's be real: open source is kinda like the group project where everyone actually *wants* to contribute. No gatekeeping, no "you can't sit with us" energy. Just people building cool stuff together, learning from each other, and making tech better for everyone.

---For me, open source isn't just about code—it's about community, learning, and giving back. It's where I've learned some of my most valuable skills, not from tutorials, but from reading real code and seeing how others solve problems.

## Why Open Source?## The Learning Experience



Let's be real: open source is kinda like the group project where everyone actually *wants* to contribute. No gatekeeping, no "you can't sit with us" energy. Just people building cool stuff together, learning from each other, and making tech better for everyone.I started out lurking on GitHub, star-ing random repos and thinking, "Whoa, these people are geniuses." Fast forward a bit, and I realized: you don't have to be a 10x dev to contribute. Sometimes it's fixing a typo, sometimes it's squashing a bug, sometimes it's just opening an issue and starting a convo.



## My JourneyEvery time I contribute to an open source project or even just read through the codebase, I learn something new. Whether it's a clever algorithm, a better way to structure code, or just seeing how experienced developers think through problems.

## The Vibes## Giving Back



- **Community > Competition**: It's not about flexing, it's about helping.- **Community > Competition**: It's not about flexing, it's about helping.

- **Learning by Doing**: Tutorials are cool, but PRs hit different.

- **Imposter Syndrome? Relatable.**: But trust me, everyone starts somewhere.One of the best feelings is when someone uses something you've built and finds it helpful. Open source lets you create tools and solutions that can help people you'll never meet, in ways you never imagined.- **Learning by Doing**: Tutorials are cool, but PRs hit different.



## How to Start- **Imposter Syndrome? Relatable.**: But trust me, everyone starts somewhere.



1. Find a project you vibe with (shameless plug: check out my GitHub).## The Community Vibe

2. Read the README (seriously, it helps).

3. Ask questions. People are nicer than you think.## How to Start

4. Make your first PR—even if it's tiny.

The open source community is different. People are genuinely helpful, welcoming, and excited to see others succeed. There's no gatekeeping—just people who love building cool stuff together.

## Final Thoughts

1. Find a project you vibe with (shameless plug: check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/heysagnik)).

Open source isn't just about code. It's about people, ideas, and making the internet a little bit cooler. So if you're on the fence, just jump in. You got this.

## My Approach2. Read the README (seriously, it helps).

Open source has taught me that the best way to learn is to build in public, fail in public, and grow in public. It's not always comfortable, but it's always worth it.

If you're thinking about getting into open source, just start. Pick a project you use, read the code, and see where you can help. The community is waiting for you.
