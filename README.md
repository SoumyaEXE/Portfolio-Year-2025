# soumya-wtf 🚀

sup! this is my corner of the internet - a vibe-check portfolio built with next.js, typescript & tailwind.

## the stack ⚡

- **next.js 15** - for that app router magic ✨
- **typescript** - keeping it type-safe
- **tailwind** - no css headaches
- **framer motion** - smooth animations
- **vercel** - deployment on autopilot

## cool stuff 💯

- dark mode only
- **ai-powered chat** with gemini 2.0 flash - responds with gen z vibes 🤖
- chat ui with message bubbles
- spotify inspired widget that actually works
- 100/100 lighthouse score (flex)
- responsive af design

## quick start 🏁

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoumyaEXE/soumya-exe.git
cd soumya-exe
npm i
npm run dev
```

open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and vibe ✌️

## ai chat setup 🤖

the portfolio has an integrated gemini ai chat that responds with gen z vibes. to enable it:

1. get your api key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
3. add your key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. restart the dev server

now the chat actually talks back with short, chill responses! 💬✨
